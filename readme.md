## About


<!-- I dont wanna write it twice dammit -->
<div id="about">

Click and drag on stuff and see if it does anything.

You can also hook up a MIDI keyboard and see what effects, faders, controllers, and pedals can control ya boi.

And if you are a normal person with a normal keyboard, boop your keebs to see which keys do stuff.

### Credits:

#### Dependencies:

Built with Tone.js, Three JS, React, R3F, Drei, Zustand, and other things I can't remember at the moment.

#### Model:

Piano 3D model inspired by Roland V-Piano Grand and modeled using Maya, but then remastered with Blender by yours truly. I already repressed all memories of Maya so don't ask me how the thing is thinging. No touchy.

#### Audio:

Samples used are not for sale, redistribution, or reuse. All Audio samples were mastered and produced using Logic Pro,  and then Adobe Audition for exporting them as mp3s because that's still a thing.

* Audio samples for `Grand Piano`, `Not a Piano`, and `Luh Mi Mumu` were produced with Logic Pro's Multi-Sampler and Alchemy.
* Audio samples for `Mochi Rage` contain vocals of my dog and processed with Universal Audio's Antares Autotune. She actually hates it when I play back her own voice to her. I get it. who likes the recording of their own voice anyway.
* Metronome Sample from <a href='https://freesound.org/' target='_blank'>freesound.org</a>

#### Arrangements / MIDI:

Arrangements are not for sale, redistribution, or reuse. Also No touchy.

* The following arrangement covers are by <a href='https://samzabala.bandcamp.com/' target='_blank'>this stupid creature</a>.
	* Teen Titans Theme Song - Piano Adrenaline Cover.

	* This Beautiful Cruel World.

	* Gravity Falls [Jazz-ish/Tango-ish Piano cover].

	* Love Me Harder.
		Originally Ariana Grande.
* The following are also by the same previous stupid creature above. Still no touchy for these sad beats. I'm working on them
